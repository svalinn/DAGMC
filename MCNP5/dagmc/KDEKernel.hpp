/**
 * \class KDEKernel
 * \brief Defines a general 1D kernel function interface
 *
 * KDEKernel is an abstract Base class that defines the methods that are
 * typically needed to implement a 1D kernel function K(u) for use with a
 * Kernel Density Estimator.
 *
 * Some of the most commonly used kernel functions can be created via the
 * createKernel() factory method.  This method allocates memory for storing
 * the object, so it will need to be deleted once it is no longer needed to
 * prevent memory leaks.
 *
 * Once a kernel has been created, it can then be evaluated using one of two
 * different methods
 *
 *     1) evaluate(double u)
 *     2) evaluate(double u, double bandwidth, double distance, int side)
 *
 * The first method evaluates the standard kernel function K(u), whereas the
 * second evaluates K_b(u) based on a boundary correction method.  This boundary
 * correction method should only be called when a calculation point lies within
 * one bandwidth of an external boundary.  Note that the current implementation
 * of this method is only valid for 2nd-order kernels.
 *
 * =======================
 * Derived Class Interface
 * =======================
 *
 * The following methods must be implemented by all Derived classes
 *
 *     1) evaluate(double u)
 *     2) get_kernel_name()
 *     3) get_order()
 *     4) get_min_quadrature(unsigned int i)
 *     5) integrate_moment(double a, double b, unsigned int i)
 *
 * To assist Derived classes in implementing method 5, there is a protected
 * MomentFunction class defined within KDEKernel that implements the Function
 * interface.  This class can be used to create general moment functions that
 * can be integrated using the integrate method in the Quadrature class.  See
 * the PolynomialKernel implementation for an example.
