/**
 * \class KDENeighborhood
 * \brief Defines a neighborhood region for a KDE mesh tally event
 *
 * KDENeighborhood is a class that defines the neighborhood region for either
 * a collision or track-based event that is to be tallied as part of a Monte
 * Carlo particle transport simulation.  This neighborhood region is formally
 * defined as the region in space for which the kernel function produces a
 * non-trivial result for any mesh node that exists inside that region.  This
 * set of mesh nodes is also known as the set of calculation points for the
 * KDE mesh tally.
 *
 * Once a KDENeighborhood has been created, the calculation points for the
 * corresponding tally event can be obtained using the get_points() method.
 * For collision events this method will return a set of unique mesh nodes
 * that are all guaranteed to produce non-trivial tally contributions.  For
 * track-based events KDENeighborhood is only an approximation to the true
 * neighborhood region.  Therefore, for these events the get_points() method
 * may return some mesh nodes that produce trivial tally contributions.
