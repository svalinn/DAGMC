    EntitySet
        An arbitrary collection of entities in MOAB, including other
        `EntitySet`'s. Parent-child relationships between `EntitySet`'s can also
        be established.

    MeshSet
        A collection of entities in MOAB. Synonymous with :term:`EntitySet`.

    Tag
        A named data field that can be associated with entities in MOAB. Each
        tag has an immutable data type. The size of the data can be fixed or
        variable.
