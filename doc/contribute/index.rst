Contribute
==========

DAGMC is an open-source BSD3-licensed project, open for anyone to fork, make
personal changes, or contribute changes back to us. DAGMC exists in the open so
that anyone can make meaningful contributions to DAGMC development. It is our
belief that allowing users to contribute and participate in development makes
DAGMC better software for everyone.

If you want to contribute to DAGMC, you should read the
`Contributors guide <contributeguide.html>`_ so that your code matches the style
guide and your workflow matches the philosophy of the project. We try hard to
test everything before release and have testing that runs daily; however, bugs
sometimes occur. We would appreciate it if users report any bugs they find on
our `Github site <DAGMC_issues_>`_.
