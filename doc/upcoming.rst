Upcoming Features
=================
Workflows
---------
 * The University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow

Speed Enhancements
--------
* We are working on a number of issues that should translate into 
  run time reductions for some models, 

Tally Enhancements
-------
 * We are working to introduce the Advanced Mesh tallies that are currently
   linked into DAG-MCNP5, into both FluDAG and DagGeant4. These tetmesh and
   KDE estimator tallies allow conformal flux results to be produced

Installation Enhancements
-------
 * It is know that the installation of the DAGMC toolkit can be quite troublesome, but 
   there are a number of things that can be done to reduce this pain, the use of installation
   package managers like *.deb *.rpm packages should make installation straightforward.
