Get DAGMC
~~~~~~~~~

As before, this guide assumes that you are building DAGMC in the subdirectory
``dagmc_bld`` of your home directory.

The first step is to clone the `DAGMC repository <DAGMC_repo_>`_.
::

    $ cd $HOME/dagmc_bld
    $ mkdir DAGMC
    $ cd DAGMC
    $ git clone https://github.com/svalinn/DAGMC
    $ cd DAGMC
    $ git checkout develop

..  _DAGMC_repo: https://github.com/svalinn/DAGMC
