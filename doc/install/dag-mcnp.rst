Apply the MCNP source code patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DAGMC can be built with MCNP5_ or MCNP6_ or both, from Los Alamos National
Laboratory. It is export-controlled software so you will need to request it from
RSICC_.

If you are building |DAG-Code|, you will need to copy the MCNP source code from
the DVD into the DAGMC repository and apply a patch so it can be used with
DAGMC. The patch you use must correspond to your version of MCNP. Currently
supported versions of MCNP5 are 5.1.40, 5.1.51, and 5.1.60.
::

    $ cd src/mcnp/mcnp5
    $ cp -r <path_to_dvd>/MCNP5/Source .
    $ chmod -R u+rw Source
    $ patch -p0 < patch/mcnp516.patch

Currently supported versions of MCNP6 are 6_beta2, 6.1, 6.1.1beta, and 6.2.
::

    $ cd src/mcnp/mcnp6
    $ cp -r <path_to_dvd>/MCNP6/Source .
    $ chmod -R u+rw Source
    $ patch -p0 < patch/mcnp620.patch

Assuming the patch or patches were succesfully applied, i.e. there were no
warnings or errors, you are now ready to configure DAGMC to produce the desired
build.

Note that all of these examples examples assume that the ``$DATAPATH``
environment variable is set. If it is not set, then the ``-DMCNP5_DATAPATH``
and/or ``-DMCNP6_DATAPATH`` cmake options must be included instead.

**Example 1:** Build the DAGMC interfaces and DAG-MCNP5.
::

    $ cmake ../src -DMOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP5=ON \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PATH

**Example 2:** Build an MPI version of DAG-MCNP5.
::

    $ cmake ../src -DMOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP5=ON \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP_MPI=ON \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PATH

**Example 3:** Build the DAGMC interfaces and DAG-MCNP6.
::

    $ cmake ../src -DMOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP6=ON \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PATH

**Example 4:** Build an MPI version of DAG-MCNP6.
::

    $ cmake ../src -DMOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP6=ON \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP_MPI=ON \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PATH

**Example 5:** Build both DAG-MCNP5 and DAG-MCNP6.
::

    $ cmake ../src -DMOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP5=ON \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP6=ON \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PATH

**Example 6:** Build MPI versions of both DAG-MCNP5 and DAG-MCNP6.
::

    $ cmake ../src -DMOAB_DIR=$HOME/dagmc_bld/MOAB \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP5=ON \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP6=ON \
                   -DBUILD_MCNP_MPI=ON \
                   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_PATH

If the CMake configuration proceeded successfully, you are now ready to install
DAGMC.
