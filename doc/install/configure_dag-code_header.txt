Configure |DAG-Code|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, create and enter the build directory.
::

    $ cd $HOME/dagmc_bld/DAGMC
    $ ln -s DAGMC src
    $ mkdir bld
    $ cd bld

Then, choose where you want to install DAGMC. This is where the binaries,
libraries, header files, etc. will be placed. This guide uses ``$INSTALL_PATH``
to represent this location.
::

    $ INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/dagmc_bld/DAGMC

CMake variables are used to configure DAGMC with your desired build options. A
few examples will be shown here, but you can see a list of all possible options
`here <cmake_options.html>`_.
