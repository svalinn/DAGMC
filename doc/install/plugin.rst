Installing the Cubit plugin
==================================

There is a common location that stores all the plugins that are available for
use. Go to the `DAGMC Plugins <DAGMC_plugins_>`_ page and download the plugin
appropriate for your operating system.

Linux install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obtain the Linux plugin from the link above. These instructions assume that you
have installed Cubit in ``/opt/Coreform-Cubit-2020.2``. If you installed it somewhere
else, modify these instructions appropriately.

These operations may need to be performed as the root user (sudo).

- Unpack the tarball in the Cubit installation folder (``/opt/Coreform-Cubit-2020.2`` by default).

OS/X install
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obtain the OS/X plugin from the link above. These instructions assume that you
have installed Cubit in ``/Applications/Coreform-Cubit-2020.2.app``. If you installed it
somewhere else, modify these instructions appropriately.

These operations may need to be performed as the root user (sudo).

- Unpack the tarball in the Cubit installation folder (``/Applications/Coreform-Cubit-2020.2.app/Contents/`` by default).

Windows install

A plugin for Windows is currently being developed; it will be posted to the
DAGMC plugins page when it is ready.
