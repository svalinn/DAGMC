DAGMC installation overview
===========================

This document describes the DAGMC installation process. Before you begin, you
should know that the following will be required:

1.  A basic understanding of Unix/Linux shell commands and how to navigate
    the shell, for installing dependencies and DAGMC enabled codes
2.  MCNP5_ or MCNP6_ source code, if you intend to install DAG-MCNP5 or
    DAG-MCNP6
3.  FLUKA_, if you intend to install FluDAG
4.  Cubit_ or Trelis_, for the creation of geometry

Once you have the basic pre-requisite peices in place you can proceed to the
DAGMC installation. There are three main steps in the DAGMC installation:

..  toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    dependencies
    dagmc
    plugin

Having completed the 3 stages of DAGMC installation, you will be ready to run
DAGMC-based radiation transport calculations. The
`User's Guide <../usersguide/index.html>`_ will guide you through the workflow
options available to you.
