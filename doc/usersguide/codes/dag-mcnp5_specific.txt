The DAG-MCNP5 input file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DAG-MCNP5 input file contains only the data cards section of a standard
MCNP5 input file.  There are no cell or surface cards included in the input
file.

A new data card has been added to DAG-MCNP5 to define parameters for the DAGMC
geometry capability.

Running DAG-MCNP5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running DAG-MCNP5 is identical to running the standard MCNP5, but a few new
keywords have been added to the command line to specify the necessary files.

:``gcad=<geom_file>`` (required): Specify the filename of the input geometry
    file. It can be in one of two formats: the MOAB (\*.h5m) format (this is the
    format produced by ``export dagmc`` in Trelis/Cubit), or a facet file
    produced by DAGMC. If this entry is not present, DAG-MCNP5 will assume that
    it is running in standard MCNP5 mode.

:``fcad=<facet_file>`` (optional): [default: fcad] Specify the filename of the
    output facet file. This is the file produced by DAGMC that contains the
    geometry as well as the products of a number of preprocessing steps, which
    can be quite time-consuming. This file can be used as input with the
    ``gcad=`` keyword in subsequent runs to avoid spending time redoing the
    preprocessing steps.

:``lcad=<log_file>`` (optional): [default: lcad] Specify the filename of the
    output log file. This is a skeleton of an MCNP file which contains
    information about the volumes, surfaces, materials and material assignments,
    boundary conditions, and tallies defined in the geometry. If you specify a
    name other than the default for this file on the command-line, that file
    will be used instead of the one generated automatically by DAG-MCNP5. This
    can be useful if you want to make small changes to your material
    assignments, importances, etc., but it cannot be used to change anything
    about the geometry. It is up to the user to ensure that the geometry file
    and log file being used correspond to each other. This runtime parameter is
    unique to DAG-MCNP5.

To run DAG-MCNP5, you must make the minimum input deck that defines the particle
source definition, runtime parameters, and physics cutoffs. You then run MCNP5
with
::

    $ mcnp5 i=input g=geom.h5m

If MCNP5 is unable to find some nuclides, you can modify the lcad file that was
produced in the previous step to remove extraneous nuclides, and re-run with
::

    $ mcnp5 i=input g=geom.h5m l=lcad_modified
