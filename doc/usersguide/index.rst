This document is intended for users of the DAGMC toolkit who want to better
understand all the potential workflows for each Monte Carlo code. UW--Madison
has developed several workflows for the Monte Carlo codes it supports. Exactly
which workflow suits your needs depends on which codes you expect to use and how
much manual data transfer you wish to do.

**N** not supported, **A** automatic production at run time, **M** manually
performed

If you are interested in running your geometry in multiple physics packages with
minimal effort, the |UW2| workflow will be the best option as it will automate
much of the work. However, if you are interested in only a specific physics
engine, one of the basic workflows may interest you more. We still would
recommend the |UW2| workflow as it offers robust and tested methods for material
creation.
