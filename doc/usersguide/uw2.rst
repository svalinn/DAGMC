University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow (UWUW)
===============================================

..  |UW2| replace:: UW\ :sup:`2`

The University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow (|UW2|) aims to solve the issue of
running the same Monte Carlo problem using mutiple physics codes. Currently, if
you wish to run the same problem in multiple codes you must fully recreate the
input file for each code, or maybe write a full syntax translator. |UW2| allows
users to tag or associate groups of volumes or surfaces with a simple human
readable syntax that is translated and stored in the geometry file of a DAGMC
problem.

The workflow uses the Python for Nuclear Engineering toolkit, PyNE_. We
leverage the existing infrastructure in PyNE to allow a consistent transport
problem to be defined across all MC codes.

Materials
~~~~~~~~~

Materials are the most painful and error-prone items to transfer from code to
code, since each MC code specifies materials in a different way. Instead, we tag
groups of volumes with a name and syntax that corresponds to material
compositions in a predefined material library.

The group naming syntax for describing materials in Cubit/Trelis is:
::

    CUBIT> group "mat:<Name of Material>"

If you wish to specify a material that is present in the library with a
different density, then
::

    CUBIT> group "mat:<Name of Material>/rho:<density>"

So for example, to specify a Stainless Steel at a density of 12.0 g/cc,
::

    CUBIT> group "mat:Stainless Steel/rho:12.0"

Scoring
~~~~~~~

Each MC code implements tallies, or scores, in very specific ways such that
there is sometimes no equivalent to a tally you may be familiar with, code to
code. However, there is a Cubit syntax to allow you to request scores on
geomemtric elments. The generic form is
::

    CUBIT> group "tally:ParticleName/ScoreType" add vol x

A specific example, scoring the neutron flux in vol 2,
::

    CUBIT> group "tally:Neutron/Flux" add vol 2

or the photon current crossing surface 3,
::

    CUBIT> group "tally:Photon/Current" add surface 3

Using the underlying PyNE libraries, we can write out the appropriate MC code
tally specification snippet; this allows the number of codes that DAGMC supports
to grow organically with those that PyNE supports. When PyNE cannot fulfill your
tally request it will warn you.

Boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All MC codes have an understanding of boundary conditions, and all at least
implement some form of graveyard, black hole or region where particles are
"killed". Some MC codes go further and define reflecting or other boundary
conditions. Furthermore, some apply these boundary conditions to entire volumes
as opposed to surfaces. Currently we support only reflecting surface
definitions, but in the near term we hope to support full volume reflecting
boundaries. One can implement reflecting surfaces in |UW2| by adding surfaces
to the following Cubit group defintion
::

    CUBIT> group "boundary:Reflecting"

or if you prefer, Lambert (white reflection)
::

    CUBIT> group "boundary:White"

Particle importances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Particle importances are in important aspect of Monte Carlo simulations and are
used to help particles to penetrate to "important" regions of the geometry.
There are several automatic methods to generate mesh based importances or
weights, but if your importances are tried to the geometry, then they can be
tagged onto the geometry.

The |UW2| workflow has a code agnostic way of defining importances.
::

    CUBIT> group "importance:Neutron/1.0"

This is translated to the code specific version at runtime. *Note: Fluka's
importance range runs from 1e-5 to 1e5, when written to file. The range is
rescaled and any out-of-range values are truncated to 1e-5 or 1e5.*

|UW2| data
~~~~~~~~~~

The |UW2| data is incorporated into the geometry file (\*.h5m) file using the
C++ program ``uwuw_preproc``, the purpose of which is to take the user's
material library, e.g. ``my_nuc_library.h5``, and extract the materials
requested, placing them into the geometry file. If you have already marked up
your geometry using the methods mentioned in previous sections, you can run the
preprocessor.
::

    $ uwuw_preproc <dagmc h5m filename> -v -l <path to nuclear data library>

Be sure to examine the output of this script which will inform you of the
materials and densities requested and also the list of tallies that were
produced. A sample output is shown below.
::

    $ uwuw_preproc test_geom.h5m -l \
          $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyne/nuc_data.h5

Also, the program will produce a fatal error if the material is not found in the
material library. There is a simulate mode (flag -s) to perform all operations
that would be performed on a normal operation, except that no data is actually
written. This can be done to test your file to make sure all the expected
materials are present in the file.

MCNP5/6-specific steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  include:: codes/dag-mcnp_specific.txt

FluDAG-specific steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a FluDAG-based UWUW problem, like the above MCNP example, the user must
make a minmal Fluka input deck defining runtime parameters and source
definition, remembering to set the ``GEOBEGIN`` to ``FLUGG``. Once this is done,
run the ``mainfludag`` executable to produce the ``mat.inp`` file which contains
all the detailed material assignments and compound descriptions.
::

    $ mainfludag geom.h5m

The user should then paste the contents of ``mat.inp`` into the main FLUKA input
deck. Now the user must make a symbolic link to the geometry file named
``dagmc.h5m``.
::

    $ ln -s geom.h5m dagmc.h5m

The ``mainfludag`` executable always looks for the ``dagmc.h5m`` file. You can
now run as if it were a standard FLUKA problem
::

    $ $FLUPRO/flutil/rfluka -N0 -M5 -e mainfludag input.inp

OpenMC-specific steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a OpenMC UWUW simulation, a ``dagmc.h5m`` file containing the UWUW model
must be present in the OpenMC run directory and a ``dagmc`` element in the
``settings.xml`` file must be set to true like so:
::

   <dagmc>true</dagmc>

OpenMC will then load the geometry and material library when setting up the simulation.

Geant4-specific steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run a DAG-Geant4-based UWUW problem, like those shown above, the user must
write a Geant4 macro file that contains at minimum the source description (GPS)
and the number of particles to simulate. The problem is then run with
::

    $ DagGeant geom.h5m input.mac

Worked example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Cubit/Trelis, and let's place some volumes to create our first problem. We
will create 4 cubes of side 10 cm, shifting each in a different direction.
::

    CUBIT> brick x 10
    CUBIT> move Volume 1 x 20 include_merged
    CUBIT> group "mat:Lead" add volume 1
    CUBIT> group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 1
    CUBIT> brick x 10
    CUBIT> move Volume 2 x -20 include_merged
    CUBIT> group "mat:Lead" add volume 2
    CUBIT> group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 2
    CUBIT> brick x 10
    CUBIT> move Volume 3 y -20 include_merged
    CUBIT> group "mat:Lead/rho:12.3" add volume 3
    CUBIT> group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 3
    CUBIT> brick x 10
    CUBIT> move Volume 4 y 20 include_merged
    CUBIT> group "mat:Lead/rho:12.3" add volume 4
    CUBIT> group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 4
    CUBIT> brick x 100
    CUBIT> brick x 105
    CUBIT> subtract volume 5 from volume 6
    CUBIT> group "mat:Graveyard" add volume 7
    CUBIT> imprint body all
    CUBIT> merge all
    CUBIT> set attribute on
    CUBIT> export acis "example.sat" overwrite

You will end up with something like this.

..  image:: uwuwexample.png
    :height: 300
    :width:  600
    :alt: An example of the geometry you should get applying the above stages

The file is now ready for preprocessing. First we must facet the file:
::

    $ dagmc_preproc example.sat -o example.h5m

Now we can insert all the material data we need:
::

    $ uwuw_preproc example.h5m -l \
          $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyne/nuc_data.h5

Your output from this step should look exactly the same as this:
::

    Making new material with name      : mat:Lead
                     with fluka_name:     LEAD
    Making new material with name      : mat:Lead/rho:12.3
                     with fluka_name:    LEAD1
    Photon PHFL1 3
    Photon PHFL2 3
    Photon PHFL3 3
    Photon PHFL4 3
    writing material, mat:Leadwriting material,     LEAD to file example.h5m
    writing material, mat:Lead/rho:12.3writing material,    LEAD1 to file example.h5m
    Writing tally PHFL1 to file example.h5m
    Writing tally PHFL2 to file example.h5m
    Writing tally PHFL3 to file example.h5m
    Writing tally PHFL4 to file example.h5m

So we see echoed back to us that we requested a graveyard and two different
material assignments: one for lead, as defined in the material library, and
another kind of lead at a different density than the library version. We also
see that 4 tallies were requested: the photon flux in each volume.

Example input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to run DAGMC, once we have made the input deck for each Monte
Carlo code. We wish to simulate 10^5 photons with energy 1 MeV emitted
isotropically from the point (0,0,0). The inputs for MCNP5 and FLUKA are shown
below.

MCNP5 example: let us call this ``mcnp.inp``.

FluDAG run
~~~~~~~~~~

For FluDAG, first we produce the ``mat.inp`` snippet file. This must then be
pasted into the full FLUKA input deck.
::

    $ mainfludag example.h5m

The ``mat.inp`` file should look like
::

    *...+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7...
    ASSIGNMA       LEAD1        1.

    * PHFLUX4
    USRTRACK         1.0    PHOTON       -21        4.1.0000e+03     1000.PHFLUX4

At this point you will need to add two lines to the input file manually. This is
because the component of the code which identifies neutron cross section data is
not yet complete.
::

    *...+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7....+....
    LOW-MAT        LEAD1       82.       -2.      296.                    LEAD

The lines above must be pasted into the FLUKA input and then run as you would
a native FLUKA problem, with the exception that we give the ``rfluka`` script an
executable argument and a new ``-d`` argument, which specifies the geometry
filename.
::

    $ $FLUPRO/flutil/rfluka -N0 -M1 -e mainfludag -d example.h5m fluka.inp

The code should run and successfully produce screen output similar to the
following. (The filepaths will change according to your system, as will the
numerical part of "fluka_26362".)

    $FLUPRO = /mnt/data/opt/fluka/fluka/

Dag-Geant4 run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dag-Geant4 is probably the most trivial of all the |UW2|-enabled codes to run.
Copy the ``vis.mac`` file from ``DAGMC/geant4/app/vis.mac``.
::

    $ DagGeant4 example.h5m

After some loading you should see a GUI window open (if you built Geant4 with
visualization enabled).  You can then use the Geant4 general particle source to
emulate the behaviour of the previous two codes.
::
