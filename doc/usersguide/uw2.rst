The University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow
----------------------------------------

.. |UW2| replace:: UW\ :sup:`2`
The University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow (|UW2|) aims to solve the 
issue of running the same Monte Carlo problem using mutiple physics codes. Currently,
if you wish to run the same problem in multiple codes you must fully recreate the
input deck for each code, or maybe write a full syntax translator. |UW2| allows users
to tag or associate groups of volumes or surfaces with a simple human readable syntax
that is translated and stored in the geometry file of a DAGMC problem.

The workflow uses the Python for Nuclear Engineering toolkit `PyNE <http://pyne.io>`_. We 
levereage the existing infrastructure in PyNE to allow a consistent transport problem to be
defined across all MC codes.

Materials
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Materials are the most painful transfer from code to code, since each MC code 
specifies materials in a different way. Instead, we tag groups of volumes
with a name and syntax that corresponds to material compositions in a predefined
material library.

The Cubit syntax for describing materials is:
::
     %> group "mat:<Name of Material>"

If you wish to specify a material that is present in the library with a different 
density, then 
::
     %> group "mat:<Name of Material>/rho:<density>"

So for example, to specify a Stainless Steel at a density of 12.0 g/cc,
::
     %> group "mat:Stainless Steel/rho:12.0"


Scoring
+++++++

Each MC code implements tallies, or scores, in very specific ways such that there
is sometimes no equivalent to a tally you may be familiar with, code to code. However, 
there is a Cubit syntax to allow you to request scores on geomemtric elments, for example,
::
     %> group "tally:Flux/Neutron"

or,
::
     %> group "tally:Photon/Current"

Using the underlying PyNE libraries we can write out the appropriate MC code 
tally specification snippet; this allows the number of codes the DAGMC 
supports to grow organically with those that PyNE supports. When PYNE cannot 
fulfill your tally request it will warn you.

Boundary Conditions
++++++++++++++++++++

All MC codes have an understanding of boundary conditions, and all at least 
implement some form of Graveyard, Blackhole or some region where particles are 
'killed'. Some MC codes go further and define reflecting or other boundary 
conditions; furthermore some apply these boundary conditions to entire Volumes 
as opposed to Surfaces.  Currently we support only reflecting surface 
definitions, but in the near term we hope to support full volume reflecting 
boundaries. One can implement reflecting surfaces in |UW2| by adding surfaces 
to the following Cubit group defintion
::
     %> group "boundary:Reflecting"

or if you prefer, Lambert (white reflection)
::
     %> group "boundary:White"

|UW2| Data
+++++++++
The |UW2| data is incorporated into the geometry file (\*.h5m) file using a 
Python script, uwuw_preproc, the purpose of which is to take the user's 
material library, e.g. my_nuc_library.h5, and extract the materials requested, 
placing them into the geometry file. Having already marked up your geometry 
using the methods mentioned in previous sections, we can run the preprocess script,
::
   %> uwuw_preproc -f <dagmc h5m filename> -d <path to nuclear data library> \
                   -o <output h5m filename>

Be sure to examine the output of this script which will inform you of the 
materials and densities requested and also the list of tallies that were 
produced. A sample output is shown below
::
   %> uwuw_preproc -f test_geom.h5m -d $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\
                     /pyne/nuc_data.h5 -o output.h5m

Also, the script will produce a fatal error if the material is not found in 
the material library
::
   %>uwuw_preproc -f test_geom.h5m -d $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
                     /pyne/nuc_data.h5 -o output.h5m
   ...
   mat:Lead
   mat:Lead/rho:12.8
   mat:Beryllium
   mat:Tungsten
   mat:Graveyard
   mat:StainlessSteel
   Material {StainlessSteel} doesn't exist in pyne material lib

Gotchas
=======
When using the "-o" option with a filename that does not match the "-f" filename 
option, `uwuw_preproc` will produce a new file with all the material and tally 
data, but absent the original geometry data. This feature allows the user to 
ensure that the `uwuw_preproc` script runs to successful completion before being 
used on the original file. Once you have ensured a sucessful run it is 
recommended that you run once more with the "-o" option set to the original 
filename, i.e.
::
   %>uwuw_preproc -f test_geom.h5m -d $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
                    /pyne/nuc_data.h5 -o output.h5m
   Success!!
   %>uwuw_preproc -f test_geom.h5m -d $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
                    /pyne/nuc_data.h5 -o test_geom.h5m
  
The reason for this behaviour is that it can take some time to produce a 
workflow-ready facet file, having done dagmc_preproc and then make_watertight
and so on.

Worked Example
+++++++++++++++

Open Cubit, and let's place some volumes to create our first problem.  We will 
create 4 cubes of side 10 cm, shifting each in a different direction
::
   %>brick x 10
   %>move Volume 1 x 20 include_merged
   %>group "mat:Lead" add volume 1
   %>group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 1
   %>brick x 10
   %>move Volume 2 x -20 include_merged
   %>group "mat:Lead" add volume 2
   %>group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 2
   %>brick x 10
   %>move Volume 3 y -20 include_merged
   %>group "mat:Lead/rho:12.3" add volume 3
   %>group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 3
   %>brick x 10
   %>move Volume 4 y 20 include_merged
   %>group "mat:Lead/rho:12.3" add volume 4
   %>group "tally:Photon/Flux" add volume 4
   %>brick x 100
   %>brick x 105
   %>subtract volume 5 from volume 6
   %>group "mat:Graveyard" add volume 7
   %>imprint body all
   %>merge all
   %>set attribute on
   %>export acis "example.sat" overwrite

The file is now ready for preprocessing. First we must facet the file:
::
   %>dagmc_preproc example.sat -o example.h5m

Now we can insert all the material data we need:
::
   %>uwuw_preproc -f example.h5m -d $HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages\
                     /pyne/nuc_data.h5 -o example.h5m

Your output from this step should look exactly the same as below
::
   Making nuc_data at example.h5m
   skipping atomic mass data table creation; already exists.
   Materials Requested....
   mat:Graveyard
   mat:Lead
   mat:Lead/rho:12.3
   Tallies Requested....
   Photon Flux PHFLUX1
   Photon Flux PHFLUX2
   Photon Flux PHFLUX3
   Photon Flux PHFLUX4

So we see echoed back to us that we requested a Graveyard and two different 
material assignments: one for Lead, as defined in the material library, and 
another kind of Lead at a different density than the library version. We 
also see that 4 tallies were requested: the photon flux in each volume.

Example Input
==============
We are now ready to run, once we have made the input deck for each Monte Carlo 
code. We wish to launch 10^5 particles from a point source located at 0 0 0, 
with isotropic angular behaviour for photons of 1 MeV. The input for MCNP and
FLUKA are shown below.

Feel free to examine the output of the run, but this provides a simple example on what to
expect.

FluDAG Run
==========
For FluDAG, first we produce the mat.inp snippet file: this must then be pasted into
the full Fluka input deck
::
   %> mainfludag example.h5m

The mat.inp file should look like
::
   *...+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7...
   ASSIGNMA       LEAD1        1.

   USRTRACK         1.0    PHOTON       -21        2.1.0000e+03     1000.PHFLUX2
   USRTRACK       10.E1     1.E-3                                               &

   USRTRACK         1.0    PHOTON       -21        3.1.0000e+03     1000.PHFLUX3

   * PHFLUX4
   USRTRACK         1.0    PHOTON       -21        4.1.0000e+03     1000.PHFLUX4
   USRTRACK       10.E1     1.E-3                                               &

As of the current time you will need to add two lines manually: this is because 
the component of the code which identifies neutron cross section data is not yet 
complete.
::
   *...+....1....+....2....+....3....+....4....+....5....+....6....+....7....+....
   LOW-MAT        LEAD1       82.       -2.      296.                    LEAD 
   LOW-MAT        LEAD2       82.       -2.      296.                    LEAD 

The lines above must be pasted into the Fluka input and then run as you would 
any Fluka, with the exception that we give the rfluka script an executable 
argument and a new "-d" argument, which specifies the geometry filename:
::
   %> $FLUPRO/flutil/rfluka -N0 -M1 -e mainfludag -d example.h5m fluka.inp

The code should run and successfully produce screen output similar to the 
following (the filepaths will change according to your system, as will the 
numerical part of "fluka_26362"):
::
   $TARGET_MACHINE = Linux
   $FLUPRO = /mnt/data/opt/fluka/fluka/

   Initial seed already existing
   Running fluka in /mnt/data/prod/uwuw_example/web_example/fluka_26362

   Saving output and random number seed
   Saving additional files generated
   Moving fort.21 to /mnt/data/prod/uwuw_example/web_example/fluka001_fort.21
   End of FLUKA run

DagSolid Run
============
DagSolid is probably the most trivial of all the |UW2| enabled codes to run.  
Copy the vis.mac file from DAGMC/geant4/build/vis.mac
::
   %> DagGeant4 example.h5m

After some loading you should see a GUI window open (if you build geant4 with 
visualisation on).  We can then use the Geant4 general particle
source to emulate the behaviour of the previous two codes:
::
   Idle> /gps/particle gamma
   Idle> /gps/ang/type iso
   Idle> /gps/energy 1.0 MeV

Now we are ready to run:
::
   Idle> /run/beamOn 1000000
