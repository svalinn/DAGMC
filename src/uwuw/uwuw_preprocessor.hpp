 * \class uwuw_preprocessor
 * \brief Defines the uwuw_preprocessor interface
 *
 * uwuw_preprocessor is a class which allows the C++ version of the uwuw preprocessor
 * program to be built. The class expects to be instantiated with 2 needed arguments
 * and 2 default arguments. The first argument defines the DAGMC file marked up with
 * appropriate instructions. The second argument defines the PyNE material library file,
 * which should contain at least the materials you specified in the DAGMC file, but can
 * contain as many as you wish. The third argument defines the output file, i.e. that which
 * you wish to output the UWUW data to. The last argument defined the verbosity of the output.
 * needed to load University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow data from the filename
 * pointed to. It contains the following private functions,
 *
 *   get_dagmc_properties(); - parses all the appropriate information from the DAGMC geometry file
 *   process_materials(); - takes all the material information found from get_dagmc_properties and turns
 *                        it into a PyNE material library
 *   process_tallies(); - takes all the tally information found from get_dagmc_properties and turns
 *                        it into a PyNE tally library
 *   write_uwuw_materials(); - writes all the material information into the output file that was specified in the
 *                           constructor. Note that the hdf5 datapath written to is "/materials"
 *   write_uwuw_tallies(); - writes all the tally information into the output file that was specified in the
 *                           constructor. Note that the hdf5 datapath written to is "/tally"
 *
 *   Once the class has been instanciated the material library, which can be read by the UWUW class, is
 *   written to the HDF5 datapath "/materials". In this library the material objects are stored along
 *   with the metadata such that each metadata name and fluka_name are unique. Similarly, the tallies
 *   are written to the HDF5 datapath "/tally". In this library the tally objects are stored along with
 *   all the tally information, such that each tally name is unique. If it is ever found that the material name
 *   or tally name isn't unique, please report that is a bug.
