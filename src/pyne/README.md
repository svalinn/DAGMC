Amalgamated PyNE Build
======================

The DAGMC toolkit now includes an amalgamated build of PyNE version 0.5. This
helps the building of DAGMC on clusters and other systems that don't necessarily
need a full installation of PyNE.

Updating Amalgamated PyNE
=========================

To update the DAGMC version of amalgamated PyNE to match the main PyNE
repository, simply execute the `update_pyne.sh` script from this directory.
Note that you will need to have astyle installed for this script to complete.
