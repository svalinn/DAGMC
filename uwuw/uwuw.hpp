/**
 * \class UWUW
 * \brief Defines the UWUW interface
 *
 * UWUW is a base class that defines the variables and methods
 * needed to load University of Wisconsin Unified Workflow data from the filename
 * pointed to. It contains the following private functions,
 *
 *    std::string get_full_filepath(char *filename);
 *    std::string get_full_filepath(std::string filename);
 *    std::map<std::string, pyne::Material> load_pyne_materials(std::string filename);
 *    std::map<std::string, pyne::Material> load_pyne_tallies(std::string filename);
 *
 * Note there are two constructors, one that takes std::string filename as argument and
 * the other char *, so both forms of strings are handled.
 *
 * The filename must be marked up appropriately with the material objects that are to be
 * used in the workflow, currently that is performed using a Python script, uwuw_preproc
 * to insert these. We use the python write_hdf5 option, with the hdf5 filepath to be
 * "/materials", so when load_hdf5() is called in this class, it looks for material objects
 * in the "/materials" path.
 *
 * Tallies are saved to "/tally", so the load_hdf5() method also looks in that path "/tally"
 * otherwise it will return a map of 0 size.
