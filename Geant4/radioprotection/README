0. INTRODUCTION

The Radioprotection example scope is to evaluate the dose in astronauts, 
in vehicle concepts and  Moon surface habitat configurations, in a 
defined interplanetary space radiation environment. 

1. GEOMETRY

The user can calculate the dose in the astronaut (phantom) in the
following set-ups:

- Vehicle configuration

      | ||sh|   |    |     |       | 
      |S||ie|   |SPE |     |       |
----> |I||ld|   |she |     |phantom|
beam  |H||in|   |lter|     |       |
      | ||g |   |    |     |       |
                            
--------------------------------------->
                                      Z axis

- The SIH is the Simplified Inflatable Habitat. 

- The shielding is  a layer of water, its scope it to protect the astronaut 
  from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The user can add, delete this element
  in the geometrical configuration, change its thickness through UI comands.

- The SPE shelter is a water layer (thickness = 75.cm along Z axis), its scope 
  it to protect the astronaut from Solar Particle Events (SPE).
  The user can add, delete this element in the geometrical configuration
  through UI comands.

- The phantom is the astronaut model; the energy deposit is collected in this
  geometrical component. The phantom is a box of water,
  it is 30. cm wide along Z axis, it is voxelised in 30 slices along Z axis. 
  The energy deposit of primary and secondary particles is collected in 
  each voxel.

- Moon Habitat configuration

------------------------------------------->
                                         Z axis
                     
- The astronaut/phantom is set in the astronaut habitat (shelter). 

- The pyramid log is made of moon soil and protects the astronaut from 
  GCR and SPE. The user can add, delete this element in the geometrical 
  configuration, change its thickness (x) through UI comands. 

- The astronaut is the phantom. A scoring mesh has been set on top of the astronaut, 
  to calculate the energy deposition.
  The astronaut is sliced along the Z axis in  30 slices. The energy deposition is integrated
  over the run and is saved in a output ASCII file. 

1.1 UI

- The user can change the geometry set-up with the following UI commands:
/configuration/choose vehicle -> choose the Vehicle configuration
/configuration/choose moon    -> choose the Moon Habitat configuration
The user can not switch between these two configurations interactively.

- The user can select in the vehicle configuration:
/configuration/AddShielding On   -> set the shielding water layer
/configuration/AddShielding Off  -> destroy the shielding water layer
/shielding/thickness 30.cm       -> set the thickness of the shielding layer
/configuration/AddSPE On         -> set the SPE shelter
/configuration/AddSPE Off        -> destroy the SPE shelter

- The user can select in the Moon surface habitat configuration:
/configuration/AddRoof On   -> set the pyramid log
/configuration/AddRoof Off  -> destroy the pyramid log
/roof/thickness 1. m        -> set the height (x) of the pyramid log

2. PHYSICS LIST

The electromagnetic physics and decay are activated by default in the physics 
list class. The user can activate the hadronic physics component interactively.
The macro to define the hadronic physics is physics.mac and it is executed by default, in the macros
vehicle1.mac, vehicle2.mac, moon.mac and interactive.mac
The threshold of production of secondary particles is fixed equal to 0.1 mm.

3. PRIMARY PARTICLES

Primary particles are generated according spectra derived from the
differential flux (CREME 96).
gcr_min_z=1.txt and gcr_min_z=2.txt contain the differential flux 
of galactic cosmic protons and alpha particles with respect to the 
energy (MeV/nucl). 
These files are read by the primary particle component of the application
and the spectra are derived.
Primary particles are generated from a point set in 
the position (0., 0., -25. m), with a direction (0., 0., 1.) by default.
The user can change these parameters interactively.


4. STEPPING

Available UI command:

/step/hadronicVerbose On  -> print the hadronic processes undertaken by 
                             particles during the run

/step/hadronicVerbose Off -> switch off the verbose level

5. ANALYSIS

The output file is remsim.root. It contains 1D histograms with the energy spectra of
- secondary particles of interest generated in the vehicle/planetary shelter and  
reaching the astronaut, 
- secondary particles of interest generated in the astronaut. 
The ROOT file is created at the beginning of the run and is closed at the end of the run.
The histograms are instantiated in the RemSimRunAction class and are filled in the RemSimSteppingAction
class. The macro macro.C is provided as example to open the remsim.root file and to plot an histogram, 
generated in the simulation.

6.SET-UP 
                                                                        
- a standard Geant4 example GNUmakefile is provided
